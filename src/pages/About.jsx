        I am Apurba Sarkar. I enjoys bringing ideas to life through code ! I
        support for creative coding, which gives you the courage to construct
        anything. I like talking about this and telling individuals how to
        improve their talents.

        I've had the honor of working for and with organizations like Qurinom
        Solutions, Teacheif Academy, Endosoft, and Wrkmen Tech Serv Solutions. I
        currently work remotely as a developer on the web and mobile platforms.
        I do a lot of demos as well. I'm talking about a lot. When it comes to
        coding, I like playing around with React, creating CSS with or without
        JavaScript, getting geeky with Node, and working with databases.

        I have a history of delivering outstanding results ahead of schedule.
        all the while paying close attention to well-structured code, design,
        accessibility, and performance. In addition to giving demos, I like to
        write articles, play games, and instruct at training facilities.
